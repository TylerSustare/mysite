## tl;dr;

Using WebSockets is a great way to build highly interactive real-time apps. Using raw WebSockets in React can be combersome.
RxJS is a great way to manage streams of data in JavaScript and makes reactive React a delight.

## Introduction - Why do this?

React is a great library for building user interfaces, but it's not a great library for building truely
**reactive** applications. RxJS is a great library for building reactive applications, but it doesn't
help build user interfaces. This article will show you how to combine the two to build a truely
reactive application with React.

##### Asside: Angular

I'm sorry to my Angular friends who have been using RxJS for years. I'm not taking anything away
from Angular. I'm only trying to show you how to use RxJS with React.

## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive porgramming is a paradigm that allows us to set up our code in a way that we accept incoming
messages and the front end **reacts** to the changes from the message. Reactive programming is framework/library
agnostic.

This is slightly different than **React.js** traditionally thinks of the world. We make state or prop changes
and the virtual dom _reacts_ to those changes.
