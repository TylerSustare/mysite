# API Gateway API Keys with the Serverless Framework

## tl;dr

We can create API Keys specifically for our API Gateway endpoints that enforce a usage policy.
We can enforce service-to-service authorization with this method, but this is a **great way to monetize our APIs!**
Normally we would have a bearer token or a JWT token that we would use to authenticate our requests.
However, API Keys are a great way to enforce authentication to our API outside of the context that someone is signed
in to our application.

Code for this example can be found on [GitHub here](https://github.com/TylerSustare/mysite/tree/main/examples/api-key)

## Setup

We'll be using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework) to deploy our API Gateway
and to create our API Keys. If you don't have your AWS environment setup, you can follow the guide
[here at the Serverless Framework docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).

### Initialize Project with Serverless Framework

Let's use `npx` so we don't have to install the serverless framework globally

```bash
$ npx serverless
```

And answer the prompts to create a new project.

```text
? What do you want to make? AWS - Node.js - Starter
? What do you want to call this project? api-key

âœ” Project successfully created in api-key folder

? What org do you want to add this service to? [Skip]

? Do you want to deploy now? No
```

### Installing Serverless Framework as a Dev Dependency

We will be using `npx` to run the serverless framework commands in this guide.
In a production app, it is wise to install the serverless framework as a dev dependency,
and use `npm run` or `yarn` to run `serverless` commands.

## Modify the `serverless.yml`

Running the `npx serverless` command created a simple `serverless.yml` file for us that should
look like this.

```yaml
service: api-key

frameworkVersion: "3"

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x # possibly a newer version

functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
```

All we need to do for this example is to add a few lines. Let's add them.

### Http Event

We have to add an `http` event to our `hello` function so that we can create an API Gateway endpoint.
This cannot be a new `httpApi` event since that will use the newer
[HTTP API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html)
and we need to use classic [REST API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-rest-api.html)
to use API Keys. [See the difference between the two here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html)

```yaml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http: # not httpApi
          path: hello
          method: get
          private: true
```

### API Keys

The quickest way to create an API Key is to add the `apiKeys` property to the `provider` object in our `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
  apiKeys:
    - tyler-tutorial-api-key
```

## Deploy

Now we can deploy our API from our command line by running the following.

```text
$ npx serverless deploy
```

Then we wait... Once the deployment is done, we will get an output to our console with the API Gateway endpoint
and our api keys.

```text
api keys: tyler-tutorial-api-key: Ai9VYOx...
endpoint: GET - https://3jkljz8892.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello
```

## Testing our API

Please feel free to use a client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test our API.
But for this example, we will use `curl` like a command line hero.

```text
$ curl https://3jkljz8892.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello
```

We get back the message

```text
{"message":"Forbidden"}%
```

Hooray! It doesn't work! We need to add our API Key as a `x-api-key` header to the request.

```text
$ curl https://3jkljz8892.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello \
     -H "x-api-key: Ai9VYOx..."
```

Now we get back the JSON we expect from our `hello` function.

```text
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "input": {
    "resource": "/hello",
    "path": "/hello",
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "headers": {
      "Accept": "*/*",
      ...
      "x-api-key": "Ai9VYOx...",
      ...
```

## Conclusion

We went through a little example of how to lock down our API endpoints by creating API Keys.

While this is a great way to make a single (or several) API Gateway API Keys for a service-to-service
authorization, it's not a great way to make hundreds or thousands of API Keys for an API we would
like to monetize.

To do that we need to programatically create API Keys and assign them to our API Gateway endpoints.
Ideally with a Usage Plan to rate limit and enforce a quota limit. We will cover that in a future post.
