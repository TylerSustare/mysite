# Mono Repo For Multiple Scoped Packages With Lerna

## tl;dr

[Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo) is what I use for my mono repos for my apps. I love it for projects where the
focus is sharing my own code. [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is now what I use for my mono repos for my packages.
In this post I'll show why. If you read nothing else, please read the [publishing](#publishing) section. It's the most differentiating
feature between Turbo and Lerna.

## Intro

Mono repos are a great setup for a fully TypeScript/JavaScript project. I use
[Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo) for my mono repos projects and it works great.
However, I recently had a need to create a mono repo for multiple scoped packages and Turbo
wasn't quite as ergonomic for package focused mono repos. I ended up using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).
Lerna is a great tool for managing multiple packages in a mono repo. Powered by NX, Lerna is
slightly more complicated than Turbo for advanced use cases.
This post will show you how to setup a mono repo with multiple scoped packages using Lerna.

### Cavitate

You absolutely can use Turbo for managing multiple scoped packages. I'm only pointing out how
easy it is to use Lerna for this use case. I'm not saying that Turbo is better or worse for
this use case.

## What is a mono repo?

A quick explanation of what a mono repo is. A mono repo is a single git repository that contains
multiple projects. The projects can be anything from a single package to a full blown application.
Instead of having multiple git repos where you have to publish a new version of each package then
bump the version of the package in the application. You can have a single code base where all the
versions are up to date. These packages are tested together and released together. Usually to a
service or set of services.

## Multiple scoped packages with Lerna

### Setup

First, we need to create a new directory for our mono repo. To use my real example, let's Initialize
the Feedback Otter JS mono repo. It's where I keep all my TypeScript/JavaScript packages for Feedback Otter.

```bash
$ mkdir feedback-otter-js
$ cd feedback-otter-js
$ npx lerna init
```

### Create a package

Now that we have a mono repo, we can create a package. Let's create the `core` package for Feedback Otter.

```bash
$ npx lerna create @feedback-otter/core
```

This will create a new directory called `packages/core` and create a `package.json` file in that directory
with the name `@feedback-otter-js/core`. This is a very slight, but important difference from Turbo in the
ergonomics of creating multiple scoped packages.

### Writing the package

I won't go into detail on how to write a package, that deserves a post of it's own (coming soon). For now,
we can use the scaffolded `core` package to display how we would use the `core` package in other packages. If
you would like to see the code for the `core` package, you can find it on [GitHub](https://FeedbackOtter/feedback-otter-js).

### Using the `core` packages

We can create a new package called `react` that uses the `core` package.

```bash
$ npx lerna create @feedback-otter/react
```

Unsurprisingly, this will create a new directory called `packages/react` and create a `package.json` file.
In that `package.json` file, we can add the `core` package as a dependency.

```json
{
  "name": "@feedback-otter/react",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@feedback-otter/core": "*"
  }
}
```

The `*` is a placeholder for the version of the `core` package. Lerna will automatically use the version
that is in our mono repo at the time. Now we can use the `core` package in the `react` package ðŸŽ‰

```jsx
import core from "@feedback-otter/core";
```

### Publishing

The most important feature of Lerna with multiple NPM packages is the ability to [publish multiple packages at once.](https://lerna.js.org/docs/features/version-and-publish)
This is a huge advantage when making a change to a package like our `core` package.
We can make a change to the `core` and bump the versions of the other packages at the same time.

```bash
$ npx lerna publish --no-private # don't publish any private packages
```

```
lerna notice cli v5.1.2
lerna info current version 0.0.0
lerna info Assuming all packages changed
? Select a new version (currently 0.0.0) Patch (0.0.1)

Changes:
 - @feedback-otter/core: 0.0.0 => 0.0.1
 - @feedback-otter/react: 0.0.0 => 0.0.1

? Are you sure you want to publish these packages? Yes
lerna info execute Skipping releases
lerna info git Pushing tags...
lerna info publish Publishing packages to npm...

Successfully published:
 - @feedback-otter/core@0.2.1
 - @feedback-otter/react@0.2.1
```

:::warning
Do not name your `publish` and `version` scripts `publish` and `version`.
This will cause Lerna to try to version/publish again which will cause an error.
`lerna ERR! EUNCOMMIT Working tree has uncommitted changes, please commit or remove the following changes before continuing:`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "publish": "lerna publish",
    "version": "lerna version"
  }
}
```

Instead name them something like `publish:packages` and `version:packages`, or whatever you prefer.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "publish:packages": "lerna publish",
    "version:packages": "lerna version"
  }
}
```

## Turbo

Turbo can definitely handle multiple packages in a mono repo. However, the focus of Turbo is on
apps. It makes sharing code between these apps incredibly easy!, but the packages as NPM packages are second
class citizens (compared to Lerna packages) This is evident when we [create a Turbo app](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new).
Where the main focus is around a Next.js app that uses shared packages.

## Conclusion

Lerna can help you manage multiple packages that depend on each other. It's an easy way to manage multiple
NPM packages that must be released together. When it comes to multiple scoped packages, Lerna is the clear
winner. It's easy to setup and use. It's also easy to use with GitHub Actions to automate the publishing of
packages.
