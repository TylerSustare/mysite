## tl;dr;

WebSockets are a great way to communicate with a server in real time. RxJS is a great way to handle streams of data.
Let's combine the two! In this post, we'll look at how to use RxJS to create a WebSocket connection and send and receive messages.

## Connect to a WebSocket

### Vannilla JS

You absolutely can use WebSockets with vanilla JavaScript. Here's a quick example:

```js
var wsURL = "ws://localhost:8080";
this.ws = new WebSocket(wsURL);
```

It's very easy to get set up, but it's not very easy to manage. You have to manually handle both
the incoming and out going messages, the connection, and the disconnection of the socket.

### RxJS

WebSockets are a first class citizen in RxJS. [The WebSocket](https://rxjs.dev/api/webSocket/webSocket)
documentation is quite detailed, so I won't go into too much detail beyond the syntax.

Here is an example of how to connect to a WebSocket with RxJS using TypeScript:

```ts
interface WebSocketMessage {
  // describe the shape of the messages
  greeting: string;
}

const wsConfig = {
  url: "ws://localhost:8080",
  openObserver: {
    next: () => {
      console.log("WS connection opened, initializing state"),
    }
  },
  closeObserver: {
    next: (_event) => {
      console.log("WS connection closing, checking for errors"),
    }
  },
};

const ws = webSocket<WebSocketMessage>(wsConfig);
ws.subscribe();
```

In this case, there is more setup. We have to define the shape of the messages we are sending and
receiving. We also define the `openObserver` and `closingObserver` to explicitly handle
the opening and closing of the WebSocket. Here we can do things like initialize state or
explicitly handle errors.

There is more boilerplate. However, we get things for free like **automatic reconnection, type safe message interfaces,
simplified message sending & receiving** among others we'll get into.

## Sending a message to the server

### Vanilla JS

```js
this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({ greeting: "Hello World" }));
```

Again, this is a simple and fine way to send a message. Especially if we create a helper function
that does the `JSON.stringify` for us.

### RxJS

```ts
ws.next({ greeting: "Hello World" });
```

This is even simpler. We can send in a plain object that adheres to our interface and RxJS will take
care of the rest.

## Receiving a message from the server

### Vanilla JS

```js
this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // ...
};
```

This is where things get a little more complicated in the vanilla JS side. We have to assign the `onmessage`
member of the WebSocket we initialized. We have to manually parse the message. This is starting to look
like why we left JQuery.

### RxJS

```ts
ws.pipe(
  tap((data) => {
    // ...
  })
).subscribe();
```

RxJS makes it very easy to handle incoming messages. We can use the `pipe` function to chain
together multiple operators before we subscribe to the WebSocket In this case, we use the `tap`
operator to set state or run side effects. We can also use the `map` operator to transform the
data. In fact, in this `pipe` we can use any of the [operators](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators) RxJS provides.

## Aside - WebSockets vs Socket.io

[Socket.io](https://socket.io/) is a fantastic alternative to using WebSockets directly. It provides a lot of the same benefits
as raw WebSockets, but will use other protocols if WebSockets are not available.
[Here is a good Stack Overflow question and discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10112178/differences-between-socket-io-and-websockets)
on the differences between the two.

We can use RxJS alongside Socket.io. However, I'm not going to go into that in this article. I'm using
a serverless WebSocket API using the Serverless Framework with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway
(Blog post coming soon on the backend). This approach doesn't support Socket.io.
